# htmlCSS
udemy html CSS course

This is a repo for a mock website built following a Udemy course for HTML5 and CSS.
This is not my own intellectual property but I did write all the code myself and use this repository for the purpose of learning to work in a VCS.
The instructor for the course and author of this code is Jonas Schmedtmann.
